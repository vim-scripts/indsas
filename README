This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3624

A Perl script to indent a lousily indented or indentless SAS script. The scripts reads in the standard input, thus best used with pipe.

Example:
cat xxx.sas| indsas
or
cat xxx.sas|indsas > new_xxx.sas


It can be invoked in VIM by adding a line to .vimrc file.
set ep=your_path_to_indsas/indsas

While you are editing a file with VIM, type this to indent the file
gg=G

NOTE:
1) indsas assumes the following SAS scripting(indenting) styles for input and merge statements:

==INPUT===
data a1;
    infile 'xxxx.txt';
    input
         var1 $
         var2 $
         .......
    ;
run;

==MERGE===
data new;
       merge
            dat1(in=a)
            dat2(in=b)
       ;
run;

2) indsas also assumes the following scripting style:
   *PROC and DATA statements are always accompanied with RUN;
   *DO,IF xxx THEN DO and ELSE DO should be closed by END;
   *PROC SQL should be closed by QUIT;

3) This script is still very primitive and does not account for all other eccentric scripting styles.
